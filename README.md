# 2D Unity Course - University of Applied Sciences Düsseldorf (HSD)

Welcome to the repository for the **2D Unity Course**, conducted at the University of Applied Sciences Düsseldorf (HSD). This repository is designed to support students in learning the basics of game development using Unity and C#.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this course is to teach the fundamentals of:
- **Unity Game Development**: Understanding the Unity Editor and its features for 2D game development.
- **C# Programming**: Writing and integrating scripts to bring games to life.

As part of the course, participants work on creating a small 2D minigame inspired by *Flappy Bird*. This project demonstrates essential game mechanics, including player control, obstacles, and basic physics.

## What's Inside

This repository includes:
- **Unity Project Files**: The complete project for the Flappy Bird-inspired minigame.
- **C# Scripts**: Core scripts that power the gameplay mechanics.
- **Assets and Resources**: Graphics and other assets used in the game.
- **Shortcut Cheat Sheet**: A quick reference guide for common shortcuts and commands in Unity, Visual Studio Code, and Git.

## Unity Version

The project was developed using **Unity 6** for 2D game development. Please ensure you have a compatible version installed to open and work with the files.
